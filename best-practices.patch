+## Best Practices (applied by rulesets)
+
+The following engineering principles are enforced through the rulesets and Copilot instructions:
+
+- **Design:** SOLID principles with a composition-first approach (avoid deep inheritance).
+- **Documentation (Public only):** All public/exported APIs must include tooltip-friendly documentation
+  (JSDoc, docstrings, XML docs, Swift `///`, GoDoc).
+- **Code Completion Friendly:** Documentation must be written so IDE code completion tooltips clearly
+  explain intent, parameters, return values, and important edge cases.
+- **Data Integrity:** If a project performs database writes, **ACID-compliant transactional boundaries**
+  are mandatory (no partial writes).

 ## Goals
 - Write safe, readable, testable Swift code.
 - Prefer modern Swift concurrency and SwiftUI where applicable.
+
+## Engineering Best Practices
+- **Design:** Apply SOLID where applicable; prefer composition over inheritance; keep responsibilities small.
+- **Public API documentation (Tooltip-friendly):** All `public`/`open` types, methods, and properties MUST have
+  `///` doc comments visible in Xcode Quick Help.
+  - Include: 1-line summary, parameter descriptions, return value (if any), and important edge cases.
+- **Data integrity (ACID / DB writes):** If this project performs database or persistent writes,
+  write operations MUST be transactional with explicit commit/rollback boundaries.
 
 ## Language & Style
 - Swift 5.9+ (or current toolchain used by the repo).

 ## Language & Runtime
 - Use TypeScript (no implicit `any`).
